Get info about someones namedays or todays namedays.

Usage:
In terminal run script without argument to get a string-list of names that have namedays today.

In terminal run script with argument (name in genitive form, e.g. Joanny, Błażeja) to get a string-list of date when 
current name has a namedays.

For example:
[In] python3 adgroup.py
[Out] Błażeja, Oskara

[In] python3 adgroup.py Joanny
[Out] 04-02, 24-05, 21-08, 09-12

adgroup.py and adgroup2.py has almost the same functionality (adgroup2.py can be used to look for namedays by date)
imieniny.json is required to run the script
